# Leaflet Challange

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). 
The USGS provides earthquake data in GeoJSON format, updated every 5 minutes. 
The dataset chosen for visualization is the USGS GeoJSON Feed, which contains information about earthquakes that occurred in the past week.

## Usage
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.      
The map should now be displayed, with earthquake markers plotted based on their coordinates.      
Click on a marker to view additional information about the earthquake in a popup.

## Customization
If you wish to use a different dataset or modify the visualization, you can make the following changes:       
Update the GeoJSON URL in the JavaScript code to point to your desired dataset.       
Modify the marker size and color based on your preference or customize the appearance of the popups.       
Add or remove any additional layers or overlays to the map.
